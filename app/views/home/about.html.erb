<h1>About Application</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This application was built as I followed a tutorial on Pluralsight on development in Ruby on Rails V4</p>
<p>This application will accept questions from users and users will also be able to answer questions. Basically a rip off of stackoverflow, and other Q&A sites.</p>
